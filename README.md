****What is Data Science?****

Data science is the study of data to extract meaningful insights for business. It is a multidisciplinary approach that combines principles and practices from the fields of mathematics, statistics, artificial intelligence, and computer engineering to analyze large amounts of data. This analysis helps data scientists to ask and answer questions like what happened, why it happened, what will happen, and what can be done with the results.


**_**Stages of Data Science life cycle**_**

**1.Capture** (data acquisition, data entry, signal reception, data extraction)

**2.Maintain** (data warehousing, data cleansing, data staging, data processing, data architecture)

**3.Process** (data mining, clustering/classification, data modeling, data summarization)

**4.Analyze** (exploratory/confirmatory, predictive analysis, regression, text mining, qualitative analysis) 

**5.Communicate** (data reporting, data visualization, business intelligence, decision making).
